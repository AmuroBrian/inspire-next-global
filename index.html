                The foundational philosophy of the Conglomerate model revolves around placing capital or the financial institution 
                at the epicenter of its operations. Under this model, subsidiary and affiliated companies collaborate with external investors, 
                political allies and affiliates, all united by a common objective: fostering capital expansion and augmenting their sphere of 
                influence. <br>
                In essence, the Conglomerate model is rooted in the strategic alignment of financial resources and relationships. It thrives 
                on the synergy between a central financial entity and a network of associated businesses, all orchestrated to maximize wealth 
                accumulation and wield substantial influence in both economic and political arenas. This intricate web of connections and interests 
                amplifies the collective capacity for growth and leverage, making the Conglomerate model a formidable force in the business world.
